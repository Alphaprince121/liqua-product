        <h1>Why We Use These Technologies</h1>
        <P>At Ritchy, producing high-quality and safe e-liquids is our topmost priority. This is why we utilize cutting-edge technologies in our production process to ensure that our customers receive the best products available. In this article, we will explain why we use these technologies and what purpose they serve.</P>

            We have been developing unique industry knowledge since 2009, enabling us to effectively and precisely control e-liquid product safety in a wide variety of areas. Our proprietary methods of nicotine analysis, calibration for hundreds of components, and 2-year shelf-life validation are just a few examples of the measures we take to ensure that our products are of the highest quality.
            
            We test 100% of all upcoming batches of raw materials for safety and standards. Our components undergo heavy metal testing on Plasma Mass-spectrometers, and non-volatiles are passed through external Liquid Mass-spectrometry equipment. We also use Volatile Components Gas Mass-Spectrometers, which is an expensive testing process common within the pharmaceutical industry. These rigorous testing standards help us ensure that our products meet the highest safety and quality standards</p>

     <p>Our in-house laboratory helps us ensure that our components are not contaminated during the testing process. This is a crucial step in ensuring the safety and quality of our products.

        We use a precision “state-of-the-art” gravimetric system, which is more in line with pharmaceutical standards, to ensure the accuracy of the dosing process. This system eliminates the possibility of operator error, and mixing accuracy variance is better than 0.1%. This helps us ensure that our products are consistently high-quality.
        
        Our vacuum sealing process ensures that all containers are uncontaminated and airtight when packed. We use Ultra-High Purity Nitrogen to remove air from production containers before mixing. All products bottled by Ritchy are then passed through vacuum testing not once but twice to surpass typical industry requirements for general transportation leakage tests. This helps us ensure that our products are protected from oxidation and other contaminants.</p>

       <p> We have been using a security and batch tracking system developed in-house since 2014. Every single bottle produced carries a 2D code that is stored in our database and is accessible to customers. This system can be used to validate a product is genuine by simply scanning the QR code and checking online. Internally, Ritchy can even check batches of Raw Materials used in the manufacture of any given product using this same code system. This helps us ensure that our customers receive only genuine products and allows us to track any potential issues quickly and efficiently.

        Ritchy stores a sample from every single batch in normal warehouse conditions. This enables technicians at Ritchy to quickly and thoroughly analyze a product for any inconsistencies while held in storage. Using the Complete Raw Material Tracing Database, Ritchy can quickly react and identify batches of products that could have potentially been affected. While nothing dangerous has ever been found in our products, the ability to quickly react and ensure that any liquid is within its specification is a unique advantage of Ritchy, and reassuring to all of our customers and ourselves.</p>
